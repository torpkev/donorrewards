#         groups:
#           - SmallDonor
#         # remove_other_groups - This true/false flag indicates if the player should be dropped from any group not listed in keep_groups below
#         remove_other groups: true
#         # keep_groups - This is a list of groups to keep the player in, only applicable if remove_other_groups = true
#         keep_groups:
#           - Owner
#           - Manager

#         cash: 200
#         # items - This is a list of items, with a count to give to the player.  These item names should match the internal
#         # minecraft names, any mis-typed will be disregarded.  The name option is an optional field for a more user friendly
#         # name to be entered for the item.  The count is the amount of items to give.  The true/false tag flag
#         # is intended for non-block items such as villager eggs, elytra etc. Each item can be tagged.  If the tag is set to true, 
#         # the item will have the players name, donation rank and date added to the item lore.  If the item is a block, if the item 
#         # is placed and then broken the tag will be lost.  
#         # Make sure the player has enough free space in their inventory before issuing this donor command.
#         items: 
#           VILLAGER_SPAWN_EGG: 
#             name: Villager Spawn Egg    # name is optional
#             count: 2
#             tag: true
#         # spawners - This is a list of mob spawners to give the player.  The type should match the entity name within minecraft
#         # any mis-typed will be disregarded.  The count is the number of spawners to give. Spawners are automatically tagged and 
#         # will have their location saved, if placed and then broken,  the tag will be reapplied.
#         spawners:
#           PIG:
#             count: 1
